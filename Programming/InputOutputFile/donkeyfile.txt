The ###### was walking slowly down the dusty road. This ######, unlike any other ###### in the village,
had a habit of ##### every few steps. People often laughed, saying, "That ###### must be dreaming!"
One little boy even tried to race the ######, but the ###### just yawned. It wasn’t a lazy ######—it was
just a thoughtful ######, ###### lost in deep ###### thoughts. Every morning, the same ###### visited the
market, waiting patiently as if it had errands. The shopkeeper smiled and said, “This ######’s smarter than
my dog.” One day, a tourist ##### if the ###### was for sale. The owner proudly replied, “Not this ######—he’s
family.” And so, the ###### became a local legend, the most famous ###### in town.
